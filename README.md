This repository contains the code used to produce the results of the manuscript: **[An empirical comparison between stochastic and deterministic centroid initialisation for K-Means variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09946)**. This branch contains code to generate the extra results (Weiszfeld's algorithm) which used in the PhD dissertation (citation pending...).

## Generate manuscript results 

To reproduce the results of the paper run *nag\_init\_methods\_generate.m* which will produce the folder *NAG_init_res*. This folder will be populated with several files in the format: *[modelName]\_model\_[setNo].mat* (for each clustering algorithm a subfolder will be created). Each of these files contains a struct array (rows: initialisation method, columns: number of data sets - default: 40). For stochastic methods multiple values are available based on the repetition of the clustering solution (default: 50).

**Struct fields:**

- *centers:* initial clustering centroids.
- *idx:* cluster index of each data point.
- *centroids:* final clustering centroids.
- *iterations:* number of iterations until convergence (not for Hartigan-Wong).
- *Silh2 & Silh:* silhouette index of the clustering solution (Silh2 was used in the manuscript).
- *wcd:* within-cluster-distance.
- *bcd:* between-cluster-distance.
- *clPur:* purity index of the clustering solution.

*nag\_init\_methods\_timing.m* runs the execution time analysis. It requires the folder *NAG_init_res* generated by *nag\_init\_methods\_generate.m*.

The results of *nag\_init\_methods\_generate.m* and *nag\_init\_methods\_timing.m* where then used to generate the figures and tables of the manuscript. For the results of a previous version of the manuscript (arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09946)) code for plotting is provided, refer to commit [9e9a00](https://github.com/avouros/Code-KMeans-benchmark/tree/9e9a00ed7c9410ce97f56173e8ec85aa86cfcc08)


## Current dependencies:

The results were produced using MATLAB R2018b with the following toolboxes:

1. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
2. Parallel Computing Toolbox (if this toolbox is not available execution is still possible).
3. [The NAG Toolbox for MATLAB](https://www.nag.co.uk/nag-toolbox-matlab) to run Hartigan and Wong's K-Means.

### Clustering Algorithms

**Hartigan-Wong K-Means:**

MATLAB's and Python's default K-Means clustering is Lloyd's K-Means (initialized with the K-Means++ method) while R uses Hartigan-Wong' K-Means. Here we use [NAG Toolbox for MATLAB](https://www.nag.co.uk/nag-toolbox-matlab) Hartigan and Wong's K-Means implementation thus in order to use this algorithm the toolbox is required.
